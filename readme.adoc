== Algorithms

Graph algorithms are used to compute metrics for graphs, nodes, or relationships.

They can provide insights on relevant entities in the graph (centralities, ranking), or inherent structures like communities (community-detection, graph-partitioning, clustering).

Many graph algorithms are iterative approaches that frequently traverse the graph for the computation using random walks, breadth-first or depth-first searches, or pattern matching.

Due to the exponential growth of possible paths with increasing distance, many of the approaches also have high algorithmic complexity.

Fortunately, optimized algorithms exist that utilize certain structures of the graph, memoize already explored parts, and parallelize operations.
Whenever possible, we've applied these optimizations.

// tag::installation[]

== Installation

=== Neo4j Desktop

If we are using the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/neo4j-desktop/index.html[Neo4j Desktop^], the library can be installed from the 'Plugins' tab of a database.

image::neo4j-desktop.jpg[width=500]

The installer will download a copy of the graph algorithms library and place it in the 'plugins' directory of the database.
It will also add the following entry to the settings file:

----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=algo.*
----

=== Neo4j Server

If we are using a standalone Neo4j Server, the library will need to be installed and configured manually.

. Download `graph-algorithms-algo-[version].jar` from https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/releases[the matching release] and copy it into the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory.
We can work out which release to download by referring to the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/blob/master/versions.json[versions file^].


. Add the following to your `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` file:
+
----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=algo.*
----
We need to give the library unrestricted access because the algorithms use the lower level Kernel API to read from, and to write to Neo4j.

+
. Restart Neo4j


=== Verifying installation

Once we've installed the library, to see a list of all the algorithms, run the following query:

----
CALL algo.list()
----

ifndef::env-docs[]
You can also see the full list in the http://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-graph-algorithms[documentation^].

// end::installation[]


// tag::usage[]
== Usage

These algorithms are exposed as Neo4j procedures.
They can be called directly from Cypher in your Neo4j Browser, from cypher-shell, or from your client code.

For most algorithms there are two procedures:

* `algo.<name>` - this procedure writes results back to the graph as node-properties, and reports statistics.
* `algo.<name>.stream` - this procedure returns a stream of data.
For example, node-ids and computed values.
+
For large graphs, the streaming procedure might return millions, or even billions of results.
In this case it may be more convenient to store the results of the algorithm, and then use them with later queries.
