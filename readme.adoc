== Algorithms

// tag::algorithms[]

=== Centralities

These algorithms determine the importance of distinct nodes in a network.

* Page Rank (`algo.pageRank`)
* Betweenness Centrality (`algo.betweenness`)
* Closeness Centrality (`algo.closeness`)
* Harmonic Centrality (`algo.harmonic`)

=== Community Detection

These algorithms evaluate how a group is clustered or partitioned, as well as its tendency to strengthen or break apart.

* Louvain (`algo.louvain`)
* Label Propagation (`algo.labelPropagation`)
* (Weakly) Connected Components (`algo.unionFind`)
* Strongly Connected Components (`algo.scc`)
* Triangle Count / Clustering Coefficient (`algo.triangleCount`)

=== Path Finding

These algorithms help find the shortest path or evaluate the availability and quality of routes.

* Minimum Weight Spanning Tree (`algo.mst`)
* All Pairs- and Single Source - Shortest Path (`algo.shortestPath`, `algo.allShortestPaths`)

// end::algorithms[]

These procedures work either on the whole graph or on a subgraph filtered by label and relationship-type.
You can also use link:#cypher-projections[filtering and projection using Cypher queries].

*We'd love your feedback*, so please try out these algorithms and let us know how well they work for your use-case.
Also please note things that are missing from the installation instructions or documentation.

Please raise https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/issues[GitHub issues] for anything you encounter or join the http://neo4j.com/developer/slack[neo4j-users Slack group] and ask in the `#neo4j-graph-algorithm` channel.

== Installation

Download `graph-algorithms-algo-*.jar` from https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/releases[the matching release] and copy it into your `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory.

Because the algorithms use the lower level Kernel API to read from and write to Neo4j you will also have to enable them in the configuration (for security reasons):

.Add to $NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf
----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=algo.*
----

Once you've done that restart Neo4j and execute the query `CALL algo.list()` to see a list of all the algorithms.

== Introduction

Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between nodes.
A graph is made up of nodes (vertices) which are connected by relationships (edges).
A graph may be _undirected_, meaning that there is no distinction between the two nodes associated with each relationship, or its relationships may be _directed_ from one node to another.
Relationships are what graph is all about: two nodes are joined by a relationship when they are related in a specified way.

We are tied to our friends.
Cities are connected by roads and airline routes.
Flora and fauna are bound together in a food web.
Countries are involved in trading relationships.
The World Wide Web is a virtual network of information.

* _Note that Neo4j stores directed relationships, we can treat them as though they are undirected when we are doing the analysis_
////

== Usage

These algorithms are exposed as Neo4j procedures.
You can call them directly from Cypher in your Neo4j Browser, from cypher-shell, or your client code.

For most algorithms we provide two procedures:

* one named `algo.<name>` that writes results back to the graph as node-properties and reports statistics.
* another named `algo.<name>.stream` that returns a stream of data, e.g. node-ids and computed values.

For large graphs the streaming procedure might return millions or billions of results, that's why it is often more convenient to store the results of the algorithm and then use them with later queries.

The general call syntax is:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.<name>([label],[relationshipType],{config})
----

e.g. Page Rank on DBpedia (11M nodes, 116M relationships):

[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank('Page','Link',{iterations:5, dampingFactor:0.85, write: true, writeProperty:'pagerank'});
// YIELD nodes, iterations, loadMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis, dampingFactor, write, writeProperty

CALL algo.pageRank.stream('Page','Link',{iterations:5, dampingFactor:0.85})
YIELD node, score
RETURN node.title, score
ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10;
----


[[cypher-projections]]
=== Projection via Cypher Queries

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Then use a node-statement instead of the label parameter and a relationship-statement instead of the relationship-type and use `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

You can also return a property value or weight (according to your config) in addition to the id's from these statements.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank(
'MATCH (p:Page) RETURN id(p) as id',
'MATCH (p1:Page)-[:Link]->(p2:Page) RETURN id(p1) as source, id(p2) as target, count(*) as weight',
{graph:'cypher', iterations:5, write: true});

== Building Locally

Currently aiming at Neo4j 3.x (with a branch per version)

----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms
cd neo4j-graph-algorithms
git checkout 3.3
mvn clean install
cp algo/target/graph-algorithms-*.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins/
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j restart
