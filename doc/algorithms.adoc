= Algorithms

Graph algorithms are used to compute metrics for graphs, nodes or relationships.

They can provide insights on relevant entities (centralities, ranking) in the graph or inherent structures like communities (community-detection, graph-partitioning, clustering).

Many of them are iterative approaches that frequently traverse the graph for the computation using random walks, breadth-first- or depth-first searches or pattern matching.

Due to the exponential growth of possible paths with increasing distance, many of the approaches also have high algorithmic complexity.

Fortunately optimized algorithms exist that utilize certain structures of the graph, memoize already explored parts, and parallelize operations.
Whenever possible we've applied these optimizations.
