= Page Rank

PageRank is Google's popular search algorithm. PageRank counts the number and quality of links to a page to determine an estimate of how important the website is.
The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.

== History, Explanation

In order to measure the relative importance of web pages, Sergey Brin and Larry Page proposed PageRank, a method for computing a ranking for every web page based on the graph of the web.
PageRank has applications in search, browsing, and traffic estimation.

PageRank is defined in the original Google paper as follows:

____
We assume page A has pages T1...Tn which point to it (i.e., are citations). The parameter d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1. We usually set d to 0.85. Also C(A) is defined as the number of links going out of page A. The PageRank of a page A is given as follows:


PR(A) = (1-d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))
____

Note that the PageRanks form a probability distribution over web pages, so the sum of all web pages' PageRanks will be one.

The underlying mathematics of PageRank has to do with random walks on networks, akin to how random surfers propagate through a network.
Precisely, PageRank is an example of a discrete ergodic Markov Chain.
Random surfers follow links, but occasionally teleport to random vertices.
The PageRank of a node is the probability it is visited by a random surfer with teleportation.
PageRank is now widely recognized as a way of detecting central nodes in a network, and even has applications in systems biology.

== When to use it / use-cases

The mathematics of PageRank are entirely general and apply to any graph or network in any domain.
PageRank is regularly used in bibliometrics, social and information network analysis, and for link prediction and recommendation.
It's even used for systems analysis of road networks, as well as biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics.

In neuroscience, the PageRank of a neuron in a neural network has been found to correlate with its relative firing rate.

Personalized PageRank is used by Twitter to present users with other accounts they may wish to follow https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande233/handouts/lecture8.pdf[[4\]].


PageRank has been used to rank spaces or streets to predict how many people (pedestrians or vehicles) come to the individual spaces or streets. In lexical semantics it has been used to perform Word Sense Disambiguation,Semantic similarity, and also to automatically rank WordNet synsets according to how strongly they possess a given semantic property, such as positivity or negativity http://nmis.isti.cnr.it/sebastiani/Publications/ACL07.pdf[[2\]].

In any ecosystem, a modified version of PageRank may be used to determine species that are essential to the continuing health of the environment http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8238462.stm[[3\]].

For the analysis of protein networks in biology PageRank is also a useful tool https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1471-2105-15-204?site=bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com[[6\]].

PageRank has been used to quantify the scientific impact of researchers http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf[[5\]].
The underlying citation and collaboration networks are used in conjunction with PageRank algorithm to come up with a ranking system for individual publications that propagates to individual authors.
The new index known as pagerank-index (Pi) is demonstrated to be fairer compared to h-index in the context of many drawbacks exhibited by h-index.

== Constraints / when not to use it

There are some major limitations of the PageRank algorithm.

A common problem is spider traps.
If there are no links from within the group to outside the groups then the group of pages is a spider trap.

Another problem is the rank sink problem.
It occurs when a network of pages form an infinite cycle.

Moreover, there exists dead-ends and dangling, links problem.
Dead-ends problem occurs, when pages have no out links.
Sometimes a page contains a link of another page which has no out links.
These types of link are known as dangling links.[1]

As we expected, we see that Home page has the highest pageRank, because it has incoming links from all other pages. We can also observe, that not only the number of incoming links is important, but also the importance of the page, that links to us.

== Example Usage

In short PageRank is a “vote”, by all the other nodes in the graph, about how important a node is. A relationship to a node counts as a vote of support. If there’s no link there’s no support (but it’s an abstention from voting rather than a vote against the node).[7]

We have to add here that the weight of the support from one node to another is related to how important the "voter" node is.

We will run PageRank on Yelp's social network to find potential influencers.
If you will check closely you can see that we saved the social network as an undirected graph.
For now there is no option to load the the relationship as undirected, but we can use cypher loading to help us solve this.
Undirected graph can be represented as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirected_graph[Bidirected graph], that is a directed graph in which the reverse of every relationship is also a relationship.

We do not have to save this reversed relationship, we can project it using *cypher loading*.
Note that relationship query does not specify direction of the relationship.
This is applicable to all other algorithms, that use *cypher loading*.

== Cypher loading

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

## Progress

- [x] single threaded implementation
- [x] tests
- [x] simple benchmark
- [x] implement procedure
- [x] benchmark on bigger graphs
- [x] parallelization
- [x] evaluation

## Requirements

- NodeIterator
- Incoming Relationships
- Outgoing Degrees

## Data structured involved

Our current approach needs one double array for storing ranks.

## ToDo

### parallelization

One approach to parallelize _PageRank_ might be to partition the node into batches - one for each thread. Nonetheless we may need to sync them at the end of each iteration.

### evaluation

- Performance tests on different dataset sizes / level of concurrency

## Future Improvements

- we might scale up the ranks to ints for faster multiplication.

== Details

Partition based parallel PageRank based on "An Efficient Partition-Based Parallel PageRank Algorithm" [1]-

- Each partition thread has its local array of only the nodes that it is responsible for,
not for all nodes. Combined, all partitions hold all page rank scores for every node once.
Instead of writing partition files and transferring them across the network
(as done in the paper since they were concerned with parallelising across multiple nodes),
we use integer arrays to write the results to.
The actual score is upscaled from a double to an integer by multiplying it with {@code 100_000}.

- To avoid contention by writing to a shared array, we partition the result array.
- During execution, the scores arrays are shaped like this:

    [ executing partition ] -> [ calculated partition ] -> [ local page rank scores ]

- Each single partition writes in a partitioned array, calculation the scores
 for every receiving partition. A single partition only sees:

    [ calculated partition ] -> [ local page rank scores ]

- The coordinating thread then builds the transpose of all written partitions from every partition:

    [ calculated partition ] -> [ executing partition ] -> [ local page rank scores ]

- This step does not happen in parallel, but does not involve extensive copying.
The local page rank scores needn't be copied, only the partitioning arrays.
All in all, {@code concurrency^2} array element reads and assignments have to
be performed.

- For the next iteration, every partition first updates its scores, in parallel.
A single partition now sees:

    [ executing partition ] -> [ local page rank scores ]

- That is, a list of all calculated scores for it self, grouped by the partition that
calculated these scores.
This means, most of the synchronization happens in parallel, too.

- Partitioning is not done by number of nodes but by the accumulated degree –
as described in "Fast Parallel PageRank: A Linear System Approach" [2].
Every partition should have about the same number of relationships to operate on.
- This is done to avoid having one partition with super nodes and instead have
all partitions run in approximately equal time.
Smaller partitions are merged down until we have at most {@code concurrency} partitions,
in order to batch partitions and keep the number of threads in use predictable/configurable.
