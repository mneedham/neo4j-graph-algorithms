= Harmonic Centrality

// tag::introduction[]
Closeness centrality works best on connected graphs - results may be confused if there are multiple connected components.

Harmonic centrality (also known as 'valued centrality') is a variant of closeness centrality that addresses this problem.
As with many of the centrality algorithms, it originates from the field of social network analysis.
// end::introduction[]


== History, Explanation

// tag::explanation[]
Harmonic centrality was proposed by Marchiori and Latora [1] while trying to come up with a sensible notion of "average shortest path".
They suggested replacing the average distance calculation from the closeness centrality algorithm with the harmonic mean of all distances.

The algorithm operates as follows:

* calculate the shortest path for each for each pair of nodes in the graph
* for each node determine the distance from the node to all other nodes based on those shortest paths

The *raw harmonic centrality* for a node is then calculated using the following formula:

`raw harmonic centrality(node) = sum(1 / distance from node to every other node excluding itself)`

As with closeness centrality we can also calculate a *normalized harmonic centrality* with the following formula:

`normalized harmonic centrality(node) = sum(1 / distance from node to every other node excluding itself) / (number of nodes - 1)`

The advantage of harmonic centrality is that âˆž are handled cleanly.
Harmonic centrality and closeness centrality will often come up with similar results, but harmonic centrality can handle graphs that aren't connected. [3]

Harmonic centrality was proposed independently by Dekker (2005)[4], using the name "valued centrality," and by Rochat (2009)[2].

== When to use it / use-cases

// tag::use-case[]
Harmonic centrality was proposed as an alternative to closeness centrality, and therefore has similar use cases.

For example, we might use it if we're trying to identify where in the city to place a new public service so that it's easily accessible for residents.
If we're trying to spread a message on social media we could use the algorithm to find the key influencers that can help us achieve our goal.

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

== Implementation Details

...

== Details

- use `org.neo4j.graphalgo.impl.msbfs.MultiSourceBFS` for BFS
- MSBFS gives depth and number of sources.
- in this scheme the farness can be calculated as follows

 inverseFarness(v) = inverseFarness(v) + numberOfSources(v) * (1/depth(v))
