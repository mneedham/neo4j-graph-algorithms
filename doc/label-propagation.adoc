= Graph Partitioning: Label Propagation

_Label Propagation_ (LPA) is an algorithm for finding communities in near linear time http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/36003/4/chapter3.pdf[[1\]].
It detects these communities using network structure alone as its guide and requires neither a pre-defined objective function nor prior information about the communities.

Community detection is an important methodology for understanding the organization of various real-world networks and has applications in problems as diverse as consensus formation in social communities or the identification of functional modules in biochemical networks.

== History, Explanation

Many community detection algorithms have been proposed and utilized with varying degrees of effectiveness in community detection research.

The idea of label flooding through a network originated from the L-shell method proposed by Bagrow and Bollt. (2005) https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0412482.pdf[[2\]]
The main idea behind LPA is to propagate the labels of node throughout the network and form communities through the process of label propagation.
The intuition of label flooding is that a single label can quickly become dominant in a densely connected group of nodes whereas it has trouble crossing a sparsely connected region.
Labels will get trapped inside a densely connected group of nodes.
Based on the idea of local trapping of labels, the author proposed a local community detection method where a node is initialized with a label which propagates step by step through the neighbours until the end of the community is reached.

LPA, which was first proposed by Raghavan et al. (2007) https://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.2938.pdf[[3\]], uses unique identifiers of nodes as labels and propagates the labels based on an agreement with the majority of the neighbour nodes.

The algorithm works as follows:

* Every node is initialized with a unique label (an identifier)
* These labels propagate through the network
* At every iteration of propagation, each node updates its label to the one that the maximum numbers of its neighbours belongs to. Ties are broken uniformly and randomly.
* LPA reaches convergence when each node has the majority label of its neighbours.

As labels propagate, densely connected groups of nodes quickly reach a consensus on a unique label.
At the end of the propagation only a few labels will remain - most will have disappeared.
Nodes that have the same label at convergence are said to belong to the same community.

== When to use it / use-cases

Community structure is considered one of the most interesting features in complex networks.
Many real-world complex systems exhibit community structure, where individuals with similar properties form a community (partition).
The identification of partitions in a network is important for understanding its structure.

There are many algorithms that identify community structures in large-scale real-world networks and a lot of them require prior information about the number and size of communities.
In complex networks this size of community is very difficult to calculate.
With social networks, which are often huge and heterogeneous in nature, it is impossible to predict the number of initial communities.

Algorithms that are able to detect communities from complex networks without having any knowledge about the number of communities or the size of communities are essential.
LPA is such an algorithm and requires neither a pre-defined objective function nor prior information about the communities.

== Constraints / when not to use it

In contrast with other algorithms label propagation can result in different community structures from the same initial condition.
The range of solutions can be narrowed if some nodes are given preliminary labels while others are held unlabelled.
Consequently, unlabelled nodes will be more likely to adapt to the labelled ones.
For a more accurate finding of communities, Jaccardâ€™s index is used to aggregate multiple community structures, containing all important information.[3]

Our algorithm found two communities with 3 members each.

=== Using pre-defined labels

_At the beginning of the algorithm, every node is initialized with unique label (called as identifier) and the labels propagate through the network._

It is possible to define preliminary labels (identifiers) of nodes using `partition` parameter.
We need to save preliminary set of labels we would like to run the LPA algorithm with as a property of nodes (must be a number).
In our example graph we saved them as property _predefined_label_.
Algorithm first checks if there is a _predefined label_ assigned to the node and loads it, if there is one.
If there isn't one it assigns the node new unique label(node id are used).
Using this preliminary set of labels (identifiers) it then sequentially updates each node's label to a new one, which is the most frequent label among its neighbors at every label propagation step(iteration).

Can be used as semi-supervised way of finding communities, where we hand-pick some initial communities.

== Cypher loading

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.
