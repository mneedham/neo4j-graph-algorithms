= Closeness Centrality

// tag::introduction[]
The _Closeness Centrality_ of a node measures the distance from that node to all other nodes.
Nodes with a high closeness score have the shortest distances to all other nodes.
The premise of this algorithm is that nodes with short distance to other nodes can spread information very efficiently through the network.
This is important for the availability of knowledge and resources.

== History, Explanation

// tag::explanation[]
Sabidussi (1966) described the sum of the shortest path distances from one node to every other node as the node’s farness.
Freeman (1979) used this idea to define closeness centrality of a node as the inverse of Sabidussi’s farness.

Closeness centrality is defined as the total number of relationships separating a node from all others along the shortest possible paths.

The algorithm operates as follows:

* calculate the shortest path for each for each pair of nodes in the graph
* for each node sum the distance from the node to all other nodes based on those shortest paths

The *raw closeness centrality* for a node is then calculated using the following formula:

`raw closeness centrality(node) = 1 / sum(distance from node to all other nodes)`

The greater the raw closeness centrality, the longer it takes for information originating at random points in the graph to arrive at the node.
We could also interpret closeness as the potential ability of a node to reach all other nodes as quickly as possible.

It is important to note that raw closeness centrality is an inverse measure of centrality.
i.e. nodes with smaller scores that are the most central.
Our algorithm returns a *normalized closeness centrality* score where nodes with a higher score are more central.

The formula for *normalized closeness centrality* is as follows:

`normalized closeness centrality(node) = (number of nodes - 1) / sum(distance from node to all other nodes)`

== When to use it / use-cases

// tag::use-case[]
This algorithm is useful for finding the nodes that can access the entire network most quickly.

We might use it if we're trying to identify where in the city to place a new public service so that it's easily accessible for residents.
If we're trying to spread a message on social media we could use the algorithm to find the key influencers that can help us achieve our goal.

This measure is preferable to degree centrality, because takes both indirected and direct connections into account.
For closeness centrality in directed networks, we split the concept into in-closeness and out-closeness.
The in-closeness variable measures the extent to which a node is easily reached by others
i.e. paths from others to the node
The out-closeness variable measures the extent to which a node can easily reach others
i.e paths from the node to others
// end::use-case[]

== Constraints / when not to use it

// tag::constraint[]
Closeness centrality works best on connected graphs.
On unconnected graphs we can end up with an infinite distance between two nodes in separate connected components.
This means that we'll end up with an infinite closeness centrality score when we sum up all the distances from that node. [1]

We may therefore choose to run the strongly connected component over our dataset before trying closeness centrality.

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

== Implementation Details

:leveloffset: +1
// copied from: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/issues/99

_Closeness Centrality_ of a node is a measure of centrality in a network, calculated as the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph.
Thus the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes.

== Details

- use `org.neo4j.graphalgo.impl.msbfs.MultiSourceBFS` for BFS
- MSBFS gives depth and number of sources.
- in this scheme the farness can be calculated as follows

 farness(v) = farness(v) + numberOfSources(v) * depth(v)
