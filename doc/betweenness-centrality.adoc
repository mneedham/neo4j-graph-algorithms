= Betweenness Centrality

_Betweenness Centrality_ is a measure of centrality in a graph based on calculating geodesic (shortest) paths between nodes.
There is at least one shortest path between every pair of nodes in a connected graph.
The shortest path can be based on the number of relationships that the path passes through in an unweighted network or the sum of the weights of the relationships in a weighted network.

The betweenness centrality for each node is the number of these shortest paths that pass through that node.
The nodes that most frequently lie on these shortest paths are will have a higher betweenness centrality score.

== History, Explanation

The original idea behind betweenness centrality was introduced by J. M. Anthonisse in his 1971 paper http://oai.cwi.nl/oai/asset/9791/9791A.pdf[The rush in a directed graph^].
Anthonisse defined the _rush_ in a graph as the amount a node in a network has to intermediate between other nodes.

Linton Freeman gave the first formal definition of betweenness centrality as one of the “three distinct intuitive conceptions of centrality” in his paper http://moreno.ss.uci.edu/23.pdf[A Set of Measures of Centrality Based on Betweenness^].
It is calculated by a breath-first search algorithm that computes the shortest paths from every node to all other nodes.
Ulrik Brandes' http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.11.2024&rep=rep1&type=pdf[Faster Algorithm for Betweenness Centrality^] is often used to make the calculation.

== When to use it / use-cases

image::{img}/betweenness_centrality.png[]

_Betweenness centrality_ is useful for finding nodes that serve as a bridge from one part of a graph to another.
As a result, it is a rudimentary measure of the control that a node exerts over the flow throughout the graph.

In the above example Alice is the main connection in the graph.
If Alice is removed all connections in the graph would be cut off.
This makes Alice “important” because she ensures that no nodes are isolated.

The betweenness score for a node can be non intuitive.
The node may have low degree, be connected to others that have low degree, and even be a long way from others on average, yet still have high betweenness.
Consider a node A that lies on a bridge between two groups of nodes within a network.
Since any path between nodes in different groups must go through this bridge, node A acquires high betweenness even though it is not well connected within either group.

_Betweenness Centrality_ has wide applicability in network theory.
It represents the degree to which nodes stand between each other.
It has founds uses in a variety of different domains [1] including:

* analyzing social and protein networks.
* identifying important bloggers
* measuring network traffic in communication networks
* studying the interaction patterns of players in massively multi player online games
* analyzing the importance of people in mobile phone call networks
* finding the controlling nodes in a telecommunications network

== Constraints / when not to use it

Betweeness centrality makes the assumption that all communication between nodes happens along the shortest path and with the same frequency, which isn't the case in real life.
It therefore doesn't give us a perfect view of the most influential nodes in a graph, but rather a good approximation. [4]

== Algorithm explanation on simple sample graph

People with high betweenness tend to be the innovators and brokers in social networks.
They combine different perspectives, transfer ideas between groups, and get power from their ability to make introductions and pull strings.

We can see that Alice is the main broker in this network and Charles is a minor broker.

== Approximation of betweenness centrality

The fastest known algorithm for exactly computing betweenness of all the nodes, designed by Brandes, requires at least `O(nm)` time for unweighted graphs, where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of relationships.
For large-scale graphs exact centrality computation isn't practical [2], but we can work with a subset of the nodes and calculate an approximate score.

=== RA-Brandes Algorithm

RA-Brandes algorithm, proposed by Brandes and Pich[3], is different from original Brandes’ algorithm in only one main respect: Brandes’ algorithm considers all nodes within the graph, while RA-Brandes considers only a subset of nodes, also known as pivots, from the graph.

We implement two strategies of selecting the subset of nodes:

* random: nodes are selected uniformly at random with defined probability of selection. Default probability is `log10(N) / e^2`. If probability is 1 then the algorithm works as original Brandes where all nodes are loaded.

* degree: first calculates the mean degree of the nodes and then allows only nodes whose degree is higher then the mean, so that only dense nodes are visited

First step in calculating betweenness centrality is to collect all shortest paths that run through specific node. With parameter `maxDepth` you can limit the depth of all shortest paths traversal.

== Cypher loading

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

In graph theory, betweenness centrality is a measure of centrality in a graph based on shortest paths. For every pair of nodes in a connected graph, there exists at least one shortest path between the nodes such that either the number of relationships that the path passes through (for unweighted graphs) or the sum of the weights of the relationships (for weighted graphs) is minimized. The betweenness centrality for each vertex is the number of these shortest paths that pass through the vertex.
