We can project the subgraph we want to run the algorithm on by using the label parameter to describe nodes, and relationship-type to describe relationships.

The general call syntax is:

.The following will run the algorithm for the label `NodeLabel` and relationship type `RelationshipType`
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.<name>('NodeLabel', "RelationshipType", {config})
----

For example, running the PageRank algorithm on DBpedia, which contains 11 million nodes and 116 million relationships:

.The following will run the write version of the algorithm, storing results in the `pagerank` property:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank('Page','Link',{iterations:5, dampingFactor:0.85, write: true, writeProperty:'pagerank'});
----

.The following will run the streaming version of the algorithm:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank.stream('Page','Link',{iterations:5, dampingFactor:0.85})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN algo.getNodeById(nodeId).title, score
ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10;
----

If we want to project a subgraph that includes all nodes and relationships in the underlying Neo4j graph, we can achieve this by passing `null` values for the label and relationship type:

.The following will run the algorithm over all nodes and relationships:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.<name>(null, null)
----


[[huge-projection]]
== Huge graph projection

The default label and relationship-type projection has a limitation of 2 billion nodes and 2 billion relationships, so if our project graph is bigger than this we need to use a huge graph projection.
This can be enabled by setting `graph:'huge'` in the config.

The general call syntax is:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.<name>('NodeLabel', "RelationshipType", {graph: "huge"})
----

For example, running the PageRank algorithm on DBpedia:

.The following will run the write version of the algorithm, storing results in the `pagerank` property:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank('Page','Link',{iterations:5, dampingFactor:0.85, writeProperty:'pagerank',graph:'huge'});
----

If we want to project a subgraph that includes all nodes and relationships in the underlying Neo4j graph, we can achieve this by passing `null` values for the label and relationship type:

.The following will run the algorithm over all nodes and relationships:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.<name>(null, null, {graph: 'huge'})
