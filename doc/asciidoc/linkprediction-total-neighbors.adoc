= The Total Neighbors algorithm

[abstract]
--
This section describes the Total Neighbors algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.
--

// tag::introduction[]
Total Neighbors computes the closeness of nodes, based on the number of unique neighbors that they have.
It is based on the idea that the more connected a node is, the more likely it is to receive new links.

== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Total Neighbors is computed using the following formula:

image::total-neighbors.svg[role="middle"]

where `N(x)` is the set of nodes adjacent to `x`, and `N(y)` is the set of nodes adjacent to `y`.

A value of 0 indicates that two nodes are not close, while higher values indicate nodes are closer.

The library contains a function to calculate the closeness between two nodes.

== Total Neighbors algorithm sample

.The following will create a sample graph:
[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/linkprediction-total-neighbors.cypher[tag=create-sample-graph]
----

.The following will return the Total Neighbors score for Michael and Karin:
[source, cypher]

| `score`
| 4.0

// end::function[]


We can also compute the score of a pair of nodes, based on a specific relationship type.

.The following will return the Total Neighbors score for Michael and Karin based only on the `FRIENDS` relationship:

[[algorithms-linkprediction-total-neighbors-syntax]]
== Syntax

.The following will run the algorithm and return the result:

RETURN algo.linkprediction.totalNeighbors(node1:Node, node2:Node, {
    relationshipQuery: null,
    direction: "BOTH"
})
