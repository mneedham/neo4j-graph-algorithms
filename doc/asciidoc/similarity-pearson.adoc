[[algorithms-similarity-pearson-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Pearson similarity is computed using the following formula:

image::pearson-similarity.png[role="middle"]

Values range between -1 and 1, where -1 is perfectly dissimilar and 1 is perfectly similar.

The library contains both procedures and functions to calculate similarity between sets of data.
The function is best used when calculating the similarity between small numbers of sets.
The procedures parallelize the computation and are therefore more appropriate for computing similarities on bigger datasets.

Pearson similarity is only calculated over non-NULL dimensions.
When calling the function, we should provide lists that contain the overlapping items.
The procedures expect to receive the same length lists for all items, so we need to pad those lists with `algo.NaN()` where necessary.

[[algorithms-similarity-pearson-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Pearson Similarity algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
We can use the Pearson Similarity algorithm to work out the similarity between two things.
We might then use the computed similarity as part of a recommendation query.
For example, to get movie recommendations based on the preferences of users who have given similar ratings to other movies that you've seen.

// end::function-cypher[]


In this example, we pass in `vectorType: "maps"` as an extra parameter, as well as using the `algo.similarity.asVector` function to construct a vector of maps containing each movie and the corresponding rating.
We do this because the Pearson Similarity algorithm needs to compute the average of *all* the movies that a user has reviewed, not just the ones that they have in common with the user we're comparing them to.
We can't therefore just pass in collections of the ratings of movies that have been reviewed by both people.

.The following will return the Pearson similarity of Arya and other people that have rated at least one movie:

// end::stream[]

Zhen and Praveena are the most similar with a score of 0.88.
The maximum score is 1.0
We also have 4 pairs of users who are not similar at all.
We'd probably want to filter those out, which we can do by passing in the `similarityCutoff` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of node pairs that have a similarity of at least 0.1, along with their Pearson similarities:

We can see that those users with no similarity have been filtered out.
If we're implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors type query we might instead want to find the most similar `k` users for a given user.
We can do that by passing in the `topK` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of users along with the most similar user to them (i.e. `k=1`):

[[algorithms-similarity-pearson-cypher-projection]]
== Cypher projection

If the similarity lists are very large they can take up a lot of memory.
For cases where those lists contain lots of values that should be skipped, you can use the less memory intensive approach of using Cypher statements to project the graph instead.

.Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config:

[[algorithms-similarity-pearson-skipping-values]]
== Skipping values

By default the `skipValue` parameter is `algo.Nan()`.
The algorithm checks every value against the `skipValue` to determine whether that value should be considered as part of the similarity result.
For cases where no values should be skipped, skipping can be disabled by setting `skipValue` to `null`.
