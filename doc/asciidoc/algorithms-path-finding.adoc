// todo introduction to graph algorithms, also say something about pregel & parallelization
// todo sensible ordering

The following path finding algorithms help find the shortest path or evaluate the availability and quality of routes:

* <<algorithms-minimum-weight-spanning-tree, Minimum Weight Spanning Tree>> (`algo.mst`)
* <<algorithms-shortest-path, Shortest Path>> (`algo.shortestPath`)
* <<algorithms-single-source-shortest-path, Single Source Shortest Path>> (`algo.shortestPath`)
* <<algorithm-all-pairs-shortest-path, All Pairs Shortest Path>> (`algo.allShortestPaths`)
* <<algorithms-a_star, A*>> (`algo.shortestPath.astar`)
* <<algorithms-yens-k-shortest-path, Yenâ€™s K-shortest paths>> (`algo.kShortestPaths`)

[WARNING]
====
As of the 3.4.7.0 release, all the Shortest Path procedures assume that they are being executed on undirected graphs
i.e. the direction of a relationship can be ignored

If you are running these algorithms on a graph where the direction is important you can override this by passing in the `direction` parameter
e.g. `direction:"INCOMING"` or `direction:"OUTGOING"`
