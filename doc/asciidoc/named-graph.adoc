As it can take some time to load large graphs into the algorithm data structures, you can pre-load graphs and then later refer to them by name when calling graph algorithm procedures.
After usage they can be removed from memory to free resources used:

== Loading a named graph

.The following will load a named graph with the name `my-graph`
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.graph.load('my-graph','Label','REL_TYPE',{graph:'heavy',..other config...})
YIELD name, graph, direction, undirected, sorted, nodes, loadMillis, alreadyLoaded,
      nodeWeight, relationshipWeight, nodeProperty, loadNodes, loadRelationships;
----

.The following will return details about a named graph
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.graph.info('my-graph')
YIELD name, type, exists, removed, nodes;
----

== Using a named graph

.The following will run the PageRank algorithm on the `my-graph` named graph
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank(null,null,{graph:'my-graph',...})
----

== Remove named graph

.The following will remove the `my-graph` named graph
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.graph.remove('my-graph')
  YIELD name, type, exists, removed, nodes;
----
