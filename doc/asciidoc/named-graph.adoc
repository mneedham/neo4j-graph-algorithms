= Named graphs

[abstract]
--
This section describes named graphs, which are stored only in memory.
When Neo4j is restarted, named graphs are lost and will need to be reloaded.
--

As it can take some time to load large graphs into the algorithm data structures, you can pre-load graphs and then later refer to them by name when calling graph algorithm procedures.
After usage, they can be removed from memory to free resources used.


== Loading a named graph

We can load named graphs using any of the approaches described in the <<projected-graph-model, projected graph model section>>.

.The following will load a graph with the name `my-graph`, for node label `Label` and relationship type `REL_TYPE`
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.graph.load('my-graph','Label','REL_TYPE',{graph:'heavy',..other config...})
YIELD name, graph, direction, undirected, sorted, nodes, loadMillis, alreadyLoaded,
      nodeWeight, relationshipWeight, nodeProperty, loadNodes, loadRelationships;
----

If we want to load a graph based on a <<cypher-projection, Cypher projection>>, we should specify `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

.The following will load a named graph using Cypher projections for nodes and relationships.
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.graph.load('my-graph',
  'MATCH (n) RETURN id(n) AS id',
  'MATCH (a)-->(b) RETURN id(a) AS source, id(b) AS target',
  {graph:'cypher',..other config...})
YIELD name, graph, direction, undirected, sorted, nodes, loadMillis, alreadyLoaded,
      nodeWeight, relationshipWeight, nodeProperty, loadNodes, loadRelationships;
----

Once we've loaded a named graph we can return details about it.

.The following will return details about a named graph:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.graph.info('my-graph')
YIELD name, type, exists, removed, nodes;
----


== Using a named graph

We can use our named graph in queries by specifying its name in the `graph` key of config.

.The following will run the PageRank algorithm on the `my-graph` named graph:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank(null,null,{graph:'my-graph',...})
----


== Remove named graph

Once we've finished using the named graph we can remove them to free up memory.

.The following will remove the `my-graph` named graph:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.graph.remove('my-graph')
YIELD name, type, exists, removed, nodes;
----
