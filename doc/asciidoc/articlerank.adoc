= The ArticleRank algorithm

[abstract]
--
This section describes the ArticleRank algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.
--

// tag::introduction[]
ArticleRank is a variant of the <<algorithms-pagerank, PageRank algorithm>>, which measures the *transitive* influence or connectivity of nodes.
// end::introduction[]


[[algorithms-articlerank-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Where ArticleRank differs to PageRank is that PageRank assumes that relationships from nodes that have a low out-degree are more important than relationships from nodes with a higher out-degree.
ArticleRank weakens this assumption.
// end::explanation[]

// tag::formula[]
ArticleRank is defined in https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/00012530911005544[ArticleRank: a PageRank‚Äêbased alternative to numbers of citations for analysing citation networks^] as follows:

----
AR(A) = (1-d) + d (AR(T1)/(C(T1) + C(AVG)) + ... + AR(Tn)/(C(Tn) + C(AVG))
----

where,

* we assume that a page `A` has pages `T1` to `Tn` which point to it (i.e., are citations).
* `d` is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1.
  It is usually set to 0.85.
* `C(A)` is defined as the number of links going out of page `A`.
* `C(AVG)` is defined as the average number of links going out of all pages.

Paper 0 is the most important paper, but it's only the 2nd most cited paper - Paper 1 has more citations.
However, Paper 1 cites Paper 0, which lets us see that it's not only the number of incoming links that is important, but also the importance of the papers behind those links.
Papers 5 and 6 are not cited by any other papers, so their score doesn't increase above the initial score of `1 - dampingFactor`.

== Huge graph projection

If our projected graph contains more than 2 billion nodes or relationships, we need to use huge graph projection, as the default label and relationship-type projection has a limitation of 2 billion nodes and 2 billion relationships.

.Set `graph:'huge'` in the config:

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/articlerank.cypher[tag=huge-projection]
----


== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe a subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
You must ensure that `graph:'cypher'` is set in the config:

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/articlerank.cypher[tag=cypher-loading]
----


== Graph type support

The ArticleRank algorithm supports the following graph types:

* [x] directed, unweighted

* [x] undirected, unweighted
