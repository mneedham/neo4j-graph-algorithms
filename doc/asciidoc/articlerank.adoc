= The ArticleRank algorithm

[abstract]
--
This section describes the ArticleRank algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.
--

// tag::introduction[]
ArticleRank is a variant of the <<algorithms-pagerank, PageRank algorithm>>, which measures the *transitive* influence or connectivity of nodes.
// end::introduction[]


[[algorithms-pagerank-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Where ArticleRank differs to PageRank is that PageRank assumes that relationships from nodes that have a low out-degree are more important than relationships from nodes with a higher out-degree.
ArticleRank weakens this assumption.
// end::explanation[]

// tag::formula[]
ArticleRank is defined in https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/00012530911005544[ArticleRank: a PageRank‚Äêbased alternative to numbers of citations for analysing citation networks^] as follows:

----
AR(A) = (1-d) + d (AR(T1)/(C(T1) + C(AVG)) + ... + AR(Tn)/(C(Tn) + C(AVG))
----

where,

* we assume that a page `A` has pages `T1` to `Tn` which point to it (i.e., are citations).
* `d` is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1.
  It is usually set to 0.85.
* `C(A)` is defined as the number of links going out of page `A`.
* `C(AVG)` is defined as the average number of links going out of all pages.

// tag::stream-sample-graph-explanation[]
As we might expect, the Home page has the highest PageRank because it has incoming links from all other pages.
We can also see that it's not only the number of incoming links that is important, but also the importance of the pages behind those links.

== Huge graph projection

If our projected graph contains more than 2 billion nodes or relationships, we need to use huge graph projection, as the default label and relationship-type projection has a limitation of 2 billion nodes and 2 billion relationships.

.Set `graph:'huge'` in the config:

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/pagerank.cypher[tag=huge-projection]
----


== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe a subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
You must ensure that `graph:'cypher'` is set in the config:

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/pagerank.cypher[tag=cypher-loading]
----


== Graph type support

The ArticleRank algorithm supports the following graph types:

* [x] directed, unweighted

* [x] undirected, unweighted
