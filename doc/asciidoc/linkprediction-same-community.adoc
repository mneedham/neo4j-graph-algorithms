= The Same Community algorithm

[abstract]
--
This section describes the Same Community algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.
--

// tag::introduction[]
Same Community is a way of determining whether two nodes belong to the same community.
These communities could be computed by using one of the <<algorithms-community>>.

// end::introduction[]


[[algorithms-linkprediction-same-community-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

If two nodes belong to the same community, there is a greater likelihood that there will be a relationship between them in future, if there isn't already.

A value of 0 indicates that two nodes are not in the same community.
A value of 1 indicates that two nodes are in the same community.

The library contains a function to calculate closeness between two nodes.

== Same Community algorithm sample

.The following will create a sample graph:

----

.The following will indicate that Michael and Zhen belong to the same community:
[source, cypher]

include::scripts/linkprediction-same-community.cypher[tag=same-community]
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]

| `score`
| 1.0

.The following will indicate that Michael and Praveena do not belong to the same community:
[source, cypher]

.Results

If one of the nodes doesn't have a community, this means it doesn't belong to the same community as any other node.

.The following will indicate that Michael and Jennifer do not belong to the same community:
[source, cypher]

By default, the community is read from the `community` property, but it is possible to explicitly state which property to read from.


.The following will indicate that Arya and Karin belong to the same community, based on the `partition` property:

== Syntax

.The following will run the algorithm and return the result:

RETURN algo.linkprediction.sameCommunity(node1:Node, node2:Node, communityProperty:String)
