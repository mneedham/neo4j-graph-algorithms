// tag::source-target-ids[]
Sometimes, we don't want to compute all pairs similarity, but would rather specify subsets of items to compare to each other.
We do this using the `sourceIds` and `targetIds` keys in the config.
// end::source-target-ids[]

// tag::computation[]
The {procedure-name} procedure computes similarity between all pairs of items.
It is a symmetrical algorithm, which means that the result from computing the similarity of Item A to Item B is the same as computing the similarity of Item B to Item A.
We can therefore compute the score for each pair of nodes once.
We don't compute the similarity of items to themselves.

The number of computations is `((# items)^2 / 2) - # items`, which can be very computationally expensive if we have a lot of items.

[NOTE]
====
{procedure-name} is only calculated over non-NULL dimensions.
The procedures expect to receive the same length lists for all items, so we need to pad those lists with `algo.NaN()` where necessary.

[NOTE]
====
{procedure-name} is only calculated over non-NULL dimensions.
When calling the function, we should provide lists that contain the overlapping items.
