== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

The Adamic Adar algorithm was introduced in 2003 by Lada Adamic and Eytan Adar to https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Friends-and-neighbors-on-the-Web-Adamic-Adar/39348c10c90be968357e2a6b65d5e0e479307735[predict links in a social network^].
It is computed using the following formula:

where `N(u)` is the set of nodes adjacent to `u`.

A value of 0 indicates that two nodes are not close, while higher values indicate nodes are closer.

The library contains a function to calculate closeness between two nodes.

We can also compute the score of a pair of nodes based on a specific relationship type.

.The following will return the Adamic Adar score for Michael and Karin based only on the `FRIENDS` relationships:
