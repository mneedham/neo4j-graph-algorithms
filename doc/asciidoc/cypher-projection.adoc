If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
This can also be used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
You can learn more in the <<cypher-projection>> section of the manual.

If the similarity lists are very large they can take up a lot of memory.
For cases where those lists contain lots of values that should be skipped, you can use the less memory-intensive approach of using Cypher statements to project the graph instead.

The Cypher loader expects to receive 3 fields:

* `item` - should contain node ids, which we can return using the `id` function.
* `category` - should contain node ids, which we can return using the `id` function.
* `weight` - should contain a double value.
