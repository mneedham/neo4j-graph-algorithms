// todo introduction to graph algorithms, also say something about pregel & parallelization
// todo sensible ordering

The following centrality algorithms determine the importance of distinct nodes in a network:

* <<algorithms-pagerank, PageRank>> (`algo.pageRank`)
* <<algorithms-articlerank, ArticleRank>> (`algo.articleRank`)
* <<algorithms-betweenness-centrality, Betweenness Centrality>> (`algo.betweenness`)
* <<algorithms-closeness-centrality, Closeness Centrality>> (`algo.closeness`)
* <<algorithms-harmonic-centrality, Harmonic Centrality>> (`algo.closeness.harmonic`)
* <<algorithms-eigenvector, Eigenvector Centrality>> (`algo.eigenvector`)
* <<algorithms-degree-centrality, Degree Centrality>> (`algo.degree`)
