== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

The Resource Allocation  algorithm was introduced in 2009 by Tao Zhou, Linyuan LÃ¼, and Yi-Cheng Zhang as part of a study to predict links in various networks.
It is computed using the following formula:

where `N(u)` is the set of nodes adjacent to `u`.

A value of 0 indicates that two nodes are not close, while higher values indicate nodes are closer.

The library contains a function to calculate closeness between two nodes.

== Resource Allocation algorithm sample

.The following will create a sample graph:
[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/linkprediction-resource-allocation.cypher[tag=create-sample-graph]
----

.The following will return the Resource Allocaiton score for Michael and Karin:
[source, cypher]

include::scripts/linkprediction-resource-allocation.cypher[tag=all-rels]
----

// tag::function[]
.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]

| `score`
| 0.5

// end::function[]


We can also compute the score of a pair of nodes based on a specific relationship type.

.The following will return the Resource Allocaiton score for Michael and Karin based only on the `FRIENDS` relationships:

[[algorithms-linkprediction-resource-allocation-syntax]]
== Syntax

.The following will run the algorithm and return the result:
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN algo.linkprediction.resourceAllocation(node1:Node, node2:Node, {
    relationshipQuery: null,
    direction: "BOTH"
})
----

| Name                   | Type    | Default        | Optional | Description
| `node1`                   | Node    | null           | no       | A node
| `node2`                   | Node    | null           | no       | Another node

| `direction`                   | String    | BOTH           | yes       | The direction of relationship type to use to compute similarity between `node1` and `node2`
